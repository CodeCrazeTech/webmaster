### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js (18.0+) and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd your-project
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Local Development

To run the documentation website locally, use the following command:

```sh
npm start
```

This will start a local development server and open the documentation website in your default web browser. Any changes you make to the documentation source files will be hot-reloaded in the browser.

### Build

To build the documentation website for production, run:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command will generate a static version of the website inside the `build` directory.
